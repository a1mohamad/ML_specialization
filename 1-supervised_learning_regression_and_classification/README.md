# ü§ñ Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning - Regression and Classification
**Machine Learning Specialization ‚Äì DeepLearning.AI and Stanford university**  
Instructor: Andrew Ng

---

## üìö Overview

This course introduces the foundations of supervised machine learning. You will learn how models like **linear regression** and **logistic regression** work, how to **train** them with gradient descent, and how to evaluate and improve their performance.

The course provides a practical and mathematical introduction, using both **NumPy** and **scikit-learn**, and concludes with best practices for developing ML models.
