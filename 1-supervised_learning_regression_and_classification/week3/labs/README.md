# Week 3 â€“ Logistic Regression & Classification
**Machine Learning Specialization, Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning â€” Regression and Classification**  
Instructor: Andrew Ng

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
This week focuses on **logistic regression**, a supervised learning algorithm used for **classification tasks**. Key concepts include:

- Classification vs Regression
- The logistic (sigmoid) function
- Logistic regression hypothesis function
- Cost function for logistic regression
- Gradient descent for logistic regression
- Decision boundary
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, Precision and Recall, F1 score

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Apply the logistic function to produce outputs between 0 and 1.
- Implement logistic regression using gradient descent.
- Interpret model outputs and decision boundaries.
- Understand how to apply logistic regression to binary classification problems.

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output
After training logistic regression on a sample dataset, the model should be able to:

- Classify new inputs into class 0 or 1
- Display a decision boundary if 2D features are used
- Show cost reduction during training

---

## âœ… Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting decision boundaries)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
