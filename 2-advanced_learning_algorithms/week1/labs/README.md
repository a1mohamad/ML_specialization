# Week 1 â€“ Multiclass Classification & Neural Network Basics (with TensorFlow)
**Machine Learning Specialization, Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms**  
Instructor: Andrew Ng

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
This week introduces **multiclass classification** and **neural network fundamentals**, with practical implementation using **TensorFlow**.

Key topics include:

- One-vs-all (OvA) logistic regression
- Neural network structure: input, hidden, output layers
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, SoftMax
- Forward propagation
- Loss functions: Cross-entropy
- Building a basic neural network in TensorFlow

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Perform multiclass classification using one-vs-all logistic regression.
- Understand and implement forward propagation in a neural network.
- Use **TensorFlow** to construct and run a neural network model.
- Apply SoftMax activation for multiclass output.
- Work with loss functions and gradient descent in TensorFlow.
