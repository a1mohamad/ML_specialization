# Course 2 - Advanced Learning Algorithms  
## Week 2: Neural Networks for Multiclass Classification

This week focuses on building and training **neural networks for multiclass classification** using a vectorized implementation.

---

## üìò Topics Covered

- One-vs-all strategy for multiclass classification
- Neural networks for multiclass problems
- Forward propagation
- Cost function for neural networks
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Vectorization of forward and backpropagation

---


## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Practiced

- Implementing a two-layer neural network
- Vectorizing forward and backward passes
- Applying SoftMax activation
- Computing cost and gradients
- Using numerical gradient checking to debug

---

## üìå Notes

- This week builds directly on Week 1 (logistic regression & binary classification).
- Pay close attention to matrix dimensions ‚Äî shape mismatches are a common source of bugs.
- If stuck, review the shapes of all variables and re-check equations from lectures.

## ‚úÖ Completion Checklist

- [x] Completed Week 2 lectures
- [x] Implemented the assignment notebook
- [x] Passed all public unit tests
- [x] Committed clean and well-documented code
