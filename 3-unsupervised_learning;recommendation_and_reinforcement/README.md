# Machine Learning Specialization — Course 3

This branch contains my work and solutions for **Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning** from the [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning?).

## 📚 Course Overview

Course 3 covers the following main topics:
- **Clustering** (K-means, hierarchical clustering, evaluation)
- **Anomaly Detection**
- **Recommender Systems**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## 🗂 Structure

- All course assignments, code, and notes are organized in folders by week or topic.
- Each notebook or script is named according to the corresponding assignment or lesson.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and check out the `course-3` branch:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a1mohamad/ML_specialization.git
    cd ML_specialization
    git checkout course-3
    ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the notebooks or scripts in your preferred IDE (e.g., Jupyter, VSCode).

## 📝 Notes

- All work in this branch is for educational purposes and to track my progress through Course 3.
- Please do not copy-paste solutions into graded assignments; use this as a learning reference.

## 📒 Folders

- `week1/` — Clustering, Anomaly Detection
- `week2/` — Recommender Systems
- `week3/` — Reinforcement Learning
- (Add more as you progress!)
