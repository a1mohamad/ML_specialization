\## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This week introduces \*\*unsupervised learning\*\* techniques for detecting anomalies and discovering patterns in data.



Key topics include:



\- Gaussian (normal) distribution

\- Anomaly detection using univariate and multivariate Gaussian

\- Parameter estimation: mean (Î¼) and variance (ÏƒÂ²)

\- Threshold selection with F1 score on cross-validation set

\- K-Means clustering algorithm

\- Random initialization of centroids

\- Cluster assignment and centroid update steps



---



\## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:



\- Model data distributions using univariate and multivariate Gaussians.

\- Implement anomaly detection to flag outliers.

\- Use F1 score to select an appropriate anomaly threshold.

\- Understand the mechanics of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

\- Apply clustering to group unlabeled data into distinct clusters.
