# Week 3 â€“ Reinforcement Learning Basics  
**Machine Learning Specialization, Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**  
Instructor: Andrew Ng

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  
This week introduces foundational concepts in **reinforcement learning (RL)**, including value functions and policy evaluation.

Key topics include:

- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- State-value functions and Bellman equations
- Policy evaluation and improvement
- Practical example: Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives  
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Understand the components of reinforcement learning: states, actions, rewards
- Compute state-value functions using Bellman equations
- Implement policy evaluation techniques
- Apply RL concepts to control tasks like Lunar Lander
- Interpret reward signals and optimize policies

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output  
- Estimated value functions for given policies  
- Visualization of Lunar Lander training episodes  
- Rewards over training iterations  
- Policy improvement and convergence plots
