## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  

This week covers the fundamentals of **recommender systems** and **dimensionality reduction** using PCA.



Key topics include:



- Content-based recommendation

- Collaborative filtering

- Matrix factorization

- Cost function and gradient descent for collaborative filtering

- Mean normalization for recommendations

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Data compression and reconstruction

- Face image compression with PCA

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives  

By the end of this week, you should be able to:



- Build a content-based recommendation system using item features.

- Implement collaborative filtering using matrix factorization.

- Train recommender models using gradient descent.

- Apply mean normalization for accurate predictions.

- Use PCA to reduce data dimensions while retaining key features.

- Apply PCA for visualization, noise reduction, and compression.
