# Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera)

This repository contains my completed labs and notes for the **Machine Learning Specialization** offered by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera, created in collaboration with **Stanford University** and **DeepLearning.AI**.

## ðŸ§  Specialization Overview

The specialization includes 3 courses:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

Each folder contains:
- My own implementation of labs and assignments
- Additional comments and explanations
- Key takeaways and insights
